For me to travel/discover new landscapes and new cultures are one of the most important things in life. As I´m used to be in different parts of the world, I appreciate a fantastic place to stay as much as you do! \r\n\r\nI decided to rent my fabulous Beachfront apartment because I think it has luxury conditions for visitors and I like to meet people from other countries. My renters are always delighted with the property and I enjoy seeing their faces as they come into the apartment and see the high standards in quality & style for their holiday. \r\n\r\nI love the place I live in, because it is calm, unbeatable, just by the seaside and for its accessibility to Oporto / Porto. Porto is close to it too (about 30 minutes away by bus from Porto and just 1 minute walk to bus stop). \r\n\r\nI love to arrive home after a long day's work in Porto / Oporto and in the minute I set foot in the entrance hall having Beach and Ocean views. The facilities on the site and the local facilities are more than you can expect with plenty to see, eat and drink. I love it: play a party of squash, swimming, walk on the beach, cycling, go to the beach bars...\r\n\r\nIt's important to me that renters can relax and enjoy the luxurious comforts of this Beachfront Penthouse whilst sampling the delights of all that Oporto / Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia has to offer. I am very happy to help in anyway, either before, or when you arrive. Just let me know what I can do to make your trip a good one!\r\n\r\nBienvenue chez vous !\r\nWelcome to you!\r\n¡A bienvenidos a usted!\r\nWillkommen bei Ihnen!\r\nBenvenuto da voi!",

Gostamos dos momentos rápidos que se arrastam no tempo. Gostamos de metamorfoses e do poder da mudança. Gostamos de convicções e de boa vontade. Gostamos de imaginação e de criatividade. Gostamos de justiça, gostamos de igualdade. Gostamos do passado e de histórias sem interesse. Gostamos de distinguir o essencial do acessório e de definir prioridades. Gostamos da capacidade para nos colocarmos no lugar dos outros: sejam eles os passados, os vindouros, os vizinhos, os estrangeiros, os de outras convicções, os animais, as plantas ou os extraterrestres. Gostamos das pessoas que gostamos e gostamos de conhecer pessoas novas. \r\nComo anfitriões gostamos de ajudar a conhecer e gostamos de não incomodar.\r\nWir lieben die fallenden Herbstblätter, wir lieben den Wind, wir lieben kleine Ideen, wir lieben die Kraft, die jeder von uns hat, die Welt zu verändern, wir lieben die Utopie und die Freiheit, wir lieben es, wenn ein Fremder einem anderen hilft, wir lieben die Reise mit einem Buch, wir lieben es, in der Erde zu wühlen, Pflanzen wachsen zu lassen, Gegenständen zu erschaffen, wir lieben den Unterschied und die Vielfalt, wir lieben sehr kleine Dinge und sehr große Dinge  und wir lieben das, was sie gemeinsam haben. Wir lieben flüchtige Momente, die sich in die Länge ziehen. Wir lieben Metamorphosen und die Kraft der Veränderung. Wir lieben Überzeugungen und das Wohlwollen. Wir lieben Phantasie und Kreativität. Wir lieben  Gerechtigkeit und Gleichberechtigung. Wir lieben Geschichten aus der Vergangenheit und belanglose Geschichten. Wir lieben es, das Wesentliche vom Nebensächlichen zu unterscheiden und Prioritäten zu setzen. Wir lieben die Fähigkeit, sich in andere hinein zu versetzen: seien es Wegbegleiter von früher oder in der Zukunft, Nachbarn, Fremde, Andersdenkende, Tiere, Pflanzen oder Wesen aus fremden Welten. Wir lieben die Menschen, die wir lieben, und wir lieben es, neue Menschen kennen zu lernen.\r\nAs Gastgeber helfen wir gern beim Kennenlernen, ohne dabei zu stören.",

Our yellow apartment.\n \nThe experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to \"tackle\" the rest of the building.\n \nAnd so we did.\n \nIn October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.\n \nWe repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.\n \nThere wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!\n  \nThe rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!\n \nRight now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)\n\nAgain all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.\n \nThis is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.\n \nWe want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.\n \nYou are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.\n \nBe prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!\n \nSo, enjoy our apartments!\n \nEugénia, October 2019",

I've been an Airbnb host for 2 years now and I love it!\r\n\r\nI've lived in Porto for most of my life and every day this city continues to amaze me. In the last couple of years Porto has been growing radically, specially when it comes to tourism, and it has been a pleasure to be part of it. Fortunately, this growth didn't affect the city's truly unique charm. It only turned it more dynamic!\r\n\r\nI'm really passionate about traveling and I've already visited more than 30 countries (and counting). But when I am not traveling what I really enjoy is welcoming people from around the world. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate getting feedback from all guests. This will help me continue to improve my hosting skills.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy Porto. See you soon!\r\n\r\n: )",

      "host_about": "Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\n\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\n\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\n\n-------\n\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. \n\nO projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.\nEnvolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. \nO nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. \nAssim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. \nAcrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.",

Teresa grew up in Tras-os-Montes in the north of Portugal and I am originally from San Francisco in the U.S.   Our professional backgrounds are in the field of education. Teresa owned and operated her own Montessori pre-school in Porto for 20 years and I taught at the local Universidade  Catolica Portuguesa. We lived in Asia for 5 years where Teresa learned the art of Chinese brush painting. You will see her paintings and other Asian touches in the decoration of our apartment..  I love taking my bicycle for a ride along the river or down the coast, stopping to eat freshly grilled fish at a local restaurant. I also like playing golf on the local courses around the Porto area.  And a great habit I picked up in Asia is the art of tea drinking – I love the ceremony around tea and can’t go a day without my Puer or Oolongs.  Teresa loves to paint and read in her spare time and has studied color therapy. \r\nWe enjoy hosting and meeting people from all over the world.  So come and share a glass of Port wine with us and spend some time in our fantastic city!",

Their taste was evident and their eagerness was remarkable. Quickly that apartment multiplied in many others, scattered around the most emblematic areas of the city. Today the team has grown and there are more than 15 people who give their best every day so that those who visit us have the best experience of their lives in the city of Oporto. This is the time when our home is your home. Our greatest determination is that our guests have the best time of their lives in the charming city of Porto, that it becomes unforgettable and contagious. Our goal is to provide all the comfort, meet the most complex request and satisfy the desire for fulfillment. Truly, this will be the most beautiful mission that we hope to accomplish.",

She visits frequently her hometown as all her family lives there and keeps up with all the new things to see or do there to the point their local friends ask her for suggestions. Sofia worked on the Tourism sector for the Portuguese Government and in those years she got to know Portugal (top to bottom) even better. Should you need any tips she will happily help!\n\n\nMatthew was born and raised in Washington DC but has been calling the Bay Area home for a while. He loves Porto and is always surprised by how much it changed the past couple of years.\n\nWhen we visit Porto we love to walk around and get lost on the streets of the city. \nIn every trip we get to see and do things we haven’t done before. \n\nOur daughters LOVE Porto. You will see that kids get a lot of attention there (and an occasional treat) and that plus the wonderful summer weather, beaches, playgrounds and parks, etc make for a very fun stay!\n\nWhen we travel to other destinations we enjoy urban hikes, delicious food (you can find us either at a fancy restaurant or a hole in the wall) and just getting to know more about the people and the place we travel to.",

You will meet the locals, the most picturesque people in town; they are very welcoming and joyous and fill the streets with their typical language and sincere generosity.    <br />Wander through the narrow streets and steep stairways in this area, have lunch in the restaurant “Caraças” (cheap and very typical) and visit the renovated cafés and shops in town. If you like walking, go down the narrow streets which you lead you to the river, hire a bike and cycle down to the seafront, where you will find wonderful beaches and esplanades for all tastes. <br />This apartment is on the first floor, has a patio at the back and is extremely comfortable and quiet.",
